US-Gun-Mortality-2020

Description:
>Ran a cross sectional analysis between gun legislation and respective homicides per capita.
>Apps used: 'R version 4.1.2 for Windows x64' and 'RStudio for Windows 2022.02.0+443'

>Due to time constraints, sample size was restricted to n=50 to analyze data between just states. Study was still statistically significant with little multicollinearity (VIF < 5). In the future, I hope to perform a more in-depth study that includes cities/zip codes.
